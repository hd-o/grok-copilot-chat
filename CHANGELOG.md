# Changelog

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 6711d10: Refresh the fallback Grok model metadata to include current xAI models and remove retired model slugs.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 5e8b4c2: Use each model's xAI `context_length` for VS Code context-window accounting, reserving configured output headroom so Grok 4.5 and other large-context models no longer all appear as 256K.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a model-specific reasoning-effort switcher to the Copilot Chat model picker and send the selected effort to supported Grok models.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 5f03e89: Harden the browser OAuth callback against forged requests and reflected markup with state-first validation, strict loopback request checks, non-reflective error pages, output encoding, and restrictive browser response headers.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 5540bfd: Fix VS Code context-window accounting, track exact xAI-billed spend and request tokens locally, and relabel response-header values as transient API rate capacity rather than account usage. Remove the inaccessible Grok-web limit probe and consolidate shared provider helpers.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b6cfd2c: Show live remaining Grok query, request, and token limits in the VS Code status bar and a detailed usage view.

## 0.1.1

- Add the branded Marketplace icon and repository cover.
- Replace the long README with focused setup, security, and development documentation.
- Keep source, tests, project documentation, and build-only files out of the published VSIX.
- Report the installed extension version in xAI request metadata.

## 0.1.0
